Hi, I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department of The University of Texas at Austin. I am very fortunate to work with my supervisor [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html) for my Ph.D. 

Before moving to Austin, I got a Bachelor's Degree at Electrical Engineering department, Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 2016. 



Research Interest
======
My research interest lies in theoretical aspects of machine/statistical learning and optimization. My Ph.D. research has focused on latent-variable problems -- how to learn from data with missing or unobserved information. I have specifically focused on the design and analysis of practically useful algorithms for them. 

Currently, I mostly focusing on the Reinforcement Learning. In connection to my previous work on EM, I am specifically looking at problems with partial observability. While I am a bit biased to the theory side, I am also looking for an opportunity to working on real-world RL applications where my theoretical discoveries could be useful.

Some Personal Life
======
I used to play the piano, mostly the pieces of Beethoven and Chopin. My favoriate songs to play are Chopin's Etude 25-11, Chopin's Ballade 4, and Beethoven's Piano Sonata 29 (hopefully upload recordings someday...). I am also a huge fan of rock and metal musics. My favorite bands are Skid row (in late 80s-90s), Stryper (glad that they are still active!). These days, I often listen to Game OST when I study or relax.

I love to play platformer games, starting from Rockman series to recent indi-games like Freedom Planet. Before I start my PhD, I have long played Starcraft and League of Legneds throughout my life, but these games are a little too intense in terms of difficulty and competition.
