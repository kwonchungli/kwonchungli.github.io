Hi, I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department of the University of Texas at Austin. I have had wonderful years of learning and working with my advisor [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html). 

Before moving to Austin, I got a Bachelor's Degree at Electrical Engineering department, Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 2016. 



Research Interest
======
I am broadly interested in theoretical aspects of machine/statistical learning and optimization, with emphasis on fundamental questions well motivated by real applications. Specifically, I have been focused on theoretical questions arising from statistical inference of latent variable models, and reinforcement learning in partially observable systems. I believe in some nice connections between these two problems. I am also interested in other research topics such as robust statistics, multitask/meta learning, and stochastic approximation.

Other aspects of life
======
I used to play the piano, mostly the pieces of Beethoven and Chopin. My favoriate songs to play are Chopin's Etude 25-11, Chopin's Ballade 4, and Beethoven's Piano Sonata 29. I am also a huge fan of rock and metal musics. My favorite bands are Skid row (in late 80s-90s), Slipknot, Stryper (glad that they are still active!). These days, I often listen to Game OST when I study or relax.

I am a fan of the game of Go, and enjoy playing it (mostly online) these days. Before I start my PhD, I have long played Starcraft and League of Legneds throughout my life, but these games require great physical which I cannot help anymore. Now I rather play more relaxing single player games -- I am also a fan of JRPG and platformer style games.
