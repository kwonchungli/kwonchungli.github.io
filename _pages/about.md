I am currently a PostDoc at Uinversity of Wisconsin-Madison, working with [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). Prior to joining UW-Madison, I received my Ph.D. in ECE department at UT Austin, where I had wonderful years of learning and working with my advisor [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html). I got my Bachelor's Degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) from Seoul National University (SNU) in 2016. 



Research Interest
======
I am broadly interested in theoretical aspects of machine/statistical learning and optimization, with emphasis on fundamental questions well motivated by real applications. Specifically, I have been focused on theoretical questions arising from statistical inference of latent variable models, and reinforcement learning in partially observable systems. I believe in some nice connections between these two problems. I am also interested in other research topics such as robust statistics, multitask/meta learning, and stochastic approximation.

Other aspects of life
======
I used to play the piano, mostly the pieces of Beethoven and Chopin. My favoriate song to play is Chopin's Etude 25-11. I am also a huge fan of rock and metal musics. My favorite bands are Skid row (in late 80s-90s), Slipknot, Stryper (glad that they are still active!). These days, I often listen to Game OST when I study or relax. 

I am a huge fan of the game of Go, and play it online in my free time. I became interested in playing Go since I watched the super match between Lee Sedol and Alphago, just as much as that event interested me to pursue my Ph.D. in machine learning, especially for RL.
