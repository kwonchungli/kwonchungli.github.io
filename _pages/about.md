Hello, I am a 3rd year PhD student in the ECE department of The University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to pursue my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html). 

Before moving to Austin, I got a Bachelor's Degree at Electrical Engineering department, Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 2016. 

Research Interests
======
My research interest is in theoretical aspect of machine/statistical learning and optimization. I am working on learning theory for mixture models with specialty in the EM algorithm. 

I am also planning to have a reading group to study the Reinforcement Learning with a focus on the learning-theoretical perspective.
