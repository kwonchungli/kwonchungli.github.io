Hello, I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department of The University of Texas at Austin. I am very fortunate to work with my supervisor [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html) for my Ph.D. 

Before moving to Austin, I got a Bachelor's Degree at Electrical Engineering department, Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 2016. 



Research Interest
======
My research interest lies in theoretical aspects of machine/statistical learning and optimization. My Ph.D. research has focused on latent-variable problems -- how to learn from data with missing or unobserved information. I have specifically focused on the design and analysis of practically useful algorithms for them. My past project has been dedicated to the theoretical understanding of why and when simple heuristics like EM succeeds. I am also interested in algorithmic approaches such as moment-based approaches and sum-of-squares proofs. 

Currently, I am working on the Reinforcement Learning. In Spring 2020, I lead a student-oriented reading group on theory of reinforcement learning. In connection to my previous work on EM, I am specifically looking at problems with partial observability. While I am a bit biased to the theory side, I am also looking for an opportunity to working on real-world RL applications where my theoretical discoveries could be useful.

Some Personal Life
======
I used to play the piano, mostly the pieces of Beethoven and Chopin. My favoriate songs to play are Chopin's Etude 25-11, Chopin's Ballade 4, and Beethoven's Piano Sonata 29 (hopefully upload recordings someday...). I am also a huge fan of rock and metal musics. My favorite bands are Skid row (in late 80s-90s), Stryper (glad that they are still active!). These days, I often listen to Game OST when I study or relax.

I love to play platformer games, starting from Rockman series to recent indi-games like Freedom Planet. Before I start my PhD, I have long played Starcraft and League of Legneds throughout my life, but these games are a little too intense in terms of difficulty and competition.
