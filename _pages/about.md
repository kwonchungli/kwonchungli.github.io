Hello, I am a 2nd year PhD student in the ECE department of The University of Texas at Austin. I am being advised by [Prof. Constantine Caramanis](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html). 

Before moving to Austin, I got a Bachelor's Degree at Electrical Engineering department, Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 2016. 

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in machine/statistical learning, optimization, and deep learning applications. I am more interested in theory and analysis, but not limited to them.
